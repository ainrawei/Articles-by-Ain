Samuel Barclay Beckett was an Irish avant-garde playwright, poet, and novelist. He was born in Foxrock, County Dublin, Republic of Ireland on April 13, 1906 (died on December 22, 1989). His parents were middle-class Protestants, and he had an older brother. In 1923, Beckett entered Trinity College in Dublin before he earned a Bachelor’s Degree in French and Italian in 1927. His interests were poetry and Romantic languages.

Beckett started teaching at Campbell College in Belfast, Northern Ireland, and soon he moved to Paris, France to teach English at L’Ecole Normale Superieure. That was where he met James Joyce, a famed Irish novelist, in 1928. About the friendship between Beckett and Joyce, James Knowlson (Beckett’s biographer) said:

"They both had degrees in French and Italian, although from different universities in Dublin. Joyce’s exceptional linguistic abilities and the wide range of his reading in Italian, German, French, and English impressed the linguist and scholar in Beckett, whose earlier studies allowed him to share with Joyce his passionate love of Dante. They both adored words — their sounds, rhythms, shapes, etymologies, and histories — and Joyce had a formidable vocabulary derived from many languages and a keen interest in the contemporary slang of several languages that Samuel Beckett admired and tried to emulate" - James Knowlson

Beckett’s first published work was Whoroscope, which earned him an award in a poetry contest and also 10 pounds. Later, he wrote his study titled Proust which then received critical acclaims for Dolphin Books series. He returned to Ireland in 1930 to teach again at Trinity College. He began writing short stories after he started teaching. Due to deep depression, he resigned from being a lecturer and moved to France again. In 1932, his first novel Dream of Fair to Middling Women was published.

Beckett lost his father in 1933, and that made Beckett’s depression worse, as well as his cyst. His physician friend asked him to go to London for treatment. Beckett began his operation with Dr. Wilfried Bion and it lasted for two years. Beckett learned German and started experimenting by writing passages in the language and later, short stories.

Beckett settled permanently in Paris in 1937. Three years later, France was invaded by Nazi Germany. Beckett was recruited by his friend Alfred Peron to the French Resistance, and in September 1941, Beckett and Suzanne Descheveux-Dusmesnil joined Gloria SMH cell of network, consists of passing on to Allied Forces in London information sent in from all over France regarding German military activities and positions. The network was infiltrated by Nazi Germans, therefore Beckett and Suzanne had to flee Paris for the southern part of France until the defeat of Nazi Germany in 1945. The two got married in 1961.
