Bilingualism (an ability to speak and understand two different languages) has been seen by scholars as an advantage to a developed brain. Learning and speaking a different language expose us to a different world and improves our perception (Konnikova, 2015). A review of evidence by Bialystok, Craik, and Luk (2012) showed that bilinguals did show “enhanced executive control” that is related to improved academic performances. Books such as “The Bilingual Edge” (King and Mackey, 2007) and “Bilingual is Better” (Flores and Soto, 2012) further promote bilingualism to raise successful children.

Angela de Bruin conducted a study to prove how strong the effect of bilingualism is towards executive functions. Based on the data in three of four tasks including the Simon task (a task of choosing one of two options based on the given clue), de Bruin found that bilingualism did not help the bilinguals to outperform the monolinguals. De Bruin believed that simple learning helped monolinguals to perform as best as the bilinguals, rather than task-switching skills and executive control. This finding then led de Bruin to review 169 conference abstracts on bilingualism and executive control from 1999 to 2012. Studies that favoured bilingual-advantage theory are most likely to be published (68%), compared to studies that provide mixed results and studies that supports monolingualism.

It is concluded that the image of the actual study outcomes on bilingualism has been distorted, and researchers and media believed that the positive impacts of bilingualism on non-linguistic cognitive processes remain uncontested (de Bruin, Treccani, and Della Sala, 2015). Some studies reviewed by de Bruin showed that being bilingual is advantageous, but “the advantage is neither global nor pervasive, as often reported” (Konnikova, 2015).

A series of studies was done by de Bruin and her advisor to examine three groups (English monolinguals, active English-Gaelic bilinguals, and passive English-Gaelic bilinguals. While the results in three of four tasks used for this study showed no difference between the groups, both active and passive bilinguals outperformed the monolinguals in the fourth task. According to de Bruin, bilingualism is indeed beneficial, despite the overstatement.

Bilingualism does not just prove an individual’s ability to switch between tasks. It also helps the aging brain. Two studies by Bialystok show that bilingual adults develop the signs of dementia four years later, and the signs of Alzheimer’s 4.3 years later, compared to monolinguals.

The overwhelming amount of studies supporting bilingualism may have made bilingualism the most overrated topic in journals and media, but we still cannot deny its advantages in helping children and adults in task-switching and slowing down the aging of the brain.
