Have you ever tried to calculate your cat’s age in human years? How did you do so? By multiplying its age by seven?

According to Hickman (2012), it is found that the method of calculating a cat’s actual age in human years using multiplication does not seem to make sense, if you consider the arithmetic. Let’s say that your cat is one year old. If you multiply one by seven, you will find that your cat’s age in human years is seven. But did you know that cats can breed kittens as early as one year old? Now, what about humans? For the record, no human has babies at the age of seven ever. This is why Hickman said that the “multiplication by seven” method does not add up. 

Cats have rapid growth in the first and second year. Throughout the time, cats experience “childhood”, “adolescence”, and “adulthood” just like humans, only faster.

Truthfully, there is no proper method for calculating a cat’s age, because a cat’s age does not follow a linear curve compared to humans (Moinard, 2015). However, veterinarians have come to agree with a guideline on how to calculate a cat’s age correctly.

Let’s assume that one-year-old is equivalent to 15 years old in human years. Next, two years old equals to 24 years old in human years. From the third year, you need to add four years to your cat’s age every year. This guideline also applies to dogs, though the difference is that one year old equals to 12 years old in human years and two years old equals to 24 years old in human years. It is noted that cats mature later than dogs in the first year, but the former start to catch up in the second year (Lacoste, 2012).

Cat years	              Human years
1 year old	            15-year-old
2 year old	            24-year-old
3 year old and over	    Add 4 years to the cat’s age each year
            Table 1.1
            
There is a remarkable difference in terms of life span between indoor and outdoor cats. Indoor cats lives longer, in contrast to the outdoor ones. Indoor cats can live up to 18 years, while outdoor cats live for 10 years due to situations such as accidents and illness. Still, a cat’s longevity depends on maintenance and care by its owner.

Apart of the guideline, there is another way to find out a cat’s age. You can ask for a vet to check on your cat’s teeth, muscle tone, coat, and eyes, because the condition of these body parts will let you know how old your cat is (Thornton, Pena & Kauffman, 2017). You can also use this method for stray cats.

No.	                    Cat’s body part	                  Description
1	                      Teeth                             2-4 weeks: kittens’ teeth start to come out
                                                          > 4 months: a permanent set of teeth appears
                                                          1-2 years old: some yellowing on the teeth
                                                          3-5 years old: tartar starts to build up on all the teeth
                                                          Older cats have more stained teeth than the younger ones.
                                                          Missing tooth/teeth also occurs to senior cats

2	                      Muscle tone                       Younger cats have more defined muscles due to their high activity level
                                                          Older cats have bonier body structure, also extra skin hanging and protruding shoulder bones

3	                      Coat                              Younger cats have softer, finer fur coat
                                                          Older cats’ fur is coarser and thicker. They also may grow grey or patches of white

4	                      Eyes                              Younger cats tend to have bright, clear eyes, without any tearing or discharge
                                                          They also have softer irises
                                                          Older cats have cloudiness in their eyes by the age of 12
                                                          Their irises may appear rough
                        Table 1.2
                        
You have figured out how to calculate your cat’s age. In my case, my cat Fifi is six years old. That equals to 40 years old in human years! Now it is your turn to find out about your feline buddy’s age.
